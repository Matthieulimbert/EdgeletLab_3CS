---------------------------------
Description :
---------------------------------

This set of Matlab and C language files detects and approximates a horizon curve in the image using multiscale edgelets (curve that goes from the left 
to the right side of the image).

It works as following :
- get the parameters
- build or load an image
- sample the columns of the image (if we do not want to compute all the pixels of the image)
- compute the edgelet transform (response of all the edgelets in the edgelet dictionnary
- solve the best path problem : find the path of edgelets (of sizes l = 1, ..., MaxLength) with the highest 
  responses that go from the left to the right side of the image. This part is computed in C language if mex is compiled successfuly
- plot the different paths on the image.


---------------------------------
How to run EdgeletLab_3C :
---------------------------------

- Run EdgeletPath.m. This file will create the Matlab path, and will try to compile the mex function in C language by running 
  CompileMex.m. If the C language function is not compiled succesfully, the computation will be done entirely in Matlab 
  (see the Matlab console to see whether or not it is compiled succesfully).

- Run Main_EdgeletLab.m. You can either run an existing scenario, invent a scenario giving manually the input parameters,
  or run the default scenario (see section "initialization of the parameters" in Main_EdgeletLab.m).
